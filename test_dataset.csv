SHe didn't do it well in BB16 and hasn't improved on it IMO... She has improved strategy, throwing comps, etc...other facets of the game... but this she hasnt I agree a lot of other people do this as well.... I'm just saying it's what separates an OK player from a good player... Nicole is an OK player IMO."
